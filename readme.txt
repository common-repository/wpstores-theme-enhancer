***Please Note:** This plugin works only with Themes from <a href="http://www.wpstores.net">WPStores</a>. Do NOT install it on other themes.*

An awesome plugin that enhances WordPress Themes from WPStores. This plugin adds the features to the theme that are normally not allowed in themes in WordPress Themes Directory. Below are the full list of the features this plugin would add:

* **Interactive Sidebar:** Adds a few selectable sections to the sidebar. This includes Social Profile Links, Tabbed Navigation (Latest Posts, Popular Posts and Latest Comments), Advertising Options etc.
* **Social Sharing Buttons:** Adds interactive social sharing buttons in your WPStore WordPress Theme.
* **SEO:** Optimize Your Blog for Search Engines with fully SEO friendly Title Tags. This option, can be disabled if you are using other dedicated SEO Plugins.
* **Author Box:** Seamlessly integrates an Author Box to your blog posts. This feature is actually taken *(modified and improved to work on WPStores Themes)* from my <a href="">Advanced Author Bio</a> Plugin.
* **Social Meta:** Adds the OpenGraph and Twitter Card Meta Tags to your blog for a beautiful social sharing experience.

+ A lot more to come.
